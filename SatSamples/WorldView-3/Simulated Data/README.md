Disclaimer and Data Information
===============================


To simulate new spatial and spectral capabilities that will be enabled by the WorldView-3 (WV-3) satellite following a successful launch and calibration, we have processed a series of surrogate data sets from a variety of sources. Because of the lack of satellite-based imaging sensors of suitable spatial and spectral resolution, airborne platforms were used. These data were resampled both spatially and spectrally, using engineering knowledge of the WV-3 sensor characteristics, in order to create simulations of WV-3 data. These simulations are notional and represent our best efforts to demonstrate a future capability that does not yet exist.

The provided data is a simulated WorldView-3 "SuperCube" - a 16 band product composed of the eight WorldView-3 VNIR bands and the eight WorldView-3 SWIR bands. The combined 16 bands are provided in a single TIFF file at the native VNIR spatial resolution of 1.2 meters. In order to simplify the presentation of the combined sensor bands, the SWIR bands are upsampled (using nearest neighbor) to 1.2 meters spatial resolution from their native resolution of 3.7 meters.

Two images are provided, derived from imagery collected by aerial platforms and sensors. These data consist of:

WV-3 1.24m Supercube reflectance simulations (2 images)
No claim is made for the accuracy of any of the simulations.

Provo Airport, Utah, USA (1.24m Supercube)
Original data provided by ITRES
 Quality: Spectral quality across all pixels is GOOD (70%), but below the quality to be anticipated from actual WV-3 based on current engineering data. The following material types in the scene were explicitly post-analyzed for spectral quality: Gravel, concrete, asphalt, steel, vegetation, and greenhouse plastic.
Tollhouse proximity, California, USA (1.24m Supercube)
 Original data provided by NEON
 Quality: Spectral and spatial quality is believed to be an EXCELLENT approximation to what is anticipated from actual WV-3 imagery based on current engineering data.
